        <p>I am a programmer with knowledge in front- and back-end development. I focus on finding errors to later document them and provide solutions. I am skilled in process optimization through automation. I like to collaborate in teams to design and maintain applications; my principles are security, scalability, and performance.</p>
        <p>In the early years of my career, I dedicated myself to studying and mastering the mechanics of one of my favorite games, aiming to become one of the top players in the region, which I achieved. This experience helped me develop skills such as teamwork, decision-making, communication, and analysis, as well as the ability to recognize certain patterns. My current goal is to refine these skills within a professional setting.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite hobbies are playing video games, feeding stray cats, and learning about new technologies. I enjoy innovating in gameplay, creating new ways to win a match or complete a game.</p>
